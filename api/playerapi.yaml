  description: This is one part of the Verona Online Assessment Standards.
    All messages are sent via the postMessage function of the html page. The player takes the page root of its parent
    as target (parent.window), and the application binds the function call to the iframe element of the player.

    Most important, the message body carries as first parameter the operationId of the message.

                fit the API version the application can offer, the player should not be used. An exception
                should be thrown.

              description: This string is important when the responses and the logs are processed. Every data
                transformation afterwards requires to know where the data came from. The type can be an ID of the
                player or a known data format.

              description: The session id flags all communication from this moment on. If a message has no or empty
                session id, it's not processed. The session id is unique and was generated by the application. Any
                simple algorithm would work. The session id helps to link the correct unit with the
                data of the message. Using the id of the player hosting html element is less reliable, because the
                element could be reused with another unit (via this StartCommand).

        restore the unit state or to analyse the response, all chunks are needed. If a chunk is sent twice, the
        first one (accourding to the time stamp) should be overwritten.
