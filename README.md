* [About pages of a unit](model/pages.md)
* [Player API](api/asyncapi.md)

## for contributors

### Markdown
This player interface is rather complex, so there is a lot to explain. It's not only about sending messages between 
pieces of code, it's also about the whole architecture of test applications to be understood. Markdown documents with 
embedded UML diagrams seems to be a suitable format to present our approach.

### UML
For discussions, we visualise models (sequences, interfaces, classes) via UML. These diagrams are stored in
this repository as *.puml files as we use [PlantUML](https://plantuml.com/) as a tool. The syntax is simple and easy 
to understand.

By editing, you might like to see the diagrams rendered on every change. This is supported by many tools depending on 
your development environment. For example, IntelliJ idea offers a plugin mechanism, and the plugins "PlantUML integration" 
by Eugene Steinberg and "PlantUML Syntax Check" by Stefan Zeller are very useful. For Visual Studio Code there are 
also good extensions in the marketplace.

In order to use the UML diagrams directly in markdown documents, one must render every UML diagram as image file and 
keep it in the repository too. We found png format very useful, because PlantUML is able to store the uml syntax in 
the png file as metadata. If only the png file is available, one can extract the syntax out of the png file.

Please render the puml files to png files before every git push. This helps on GitHub to evaluate the changes. You need 
to install PlantUML on your computer. It's a Java application, so ensure that Java is installed too. Assuming that 
`plantuml.jar` resides in one folder above the project, the following command (on PC) will process all changed puml files
in subfolder `model` as png files into the subfolder `model/png`. 

```
java -jar ..\plantuml.jar -checkmetadata -o png model\*.puml   
```

### API
The API definition is very important, because all programming relies on it. We strongly suggest that an API definition 
is used for e2e testing. This requires an API definition standard format that can be read by computers. We went for
the [AsyncAPI](https://www.asyncapi.com/) specification, because we deal with asynchronous messages rather 
then HTTP requests.

The API definition in AsyncAPI format is stored in this repository. We prefer the yaml format rather then the 
JSON format. The corresponding and better readable markdown document should be created right after changes of the 
definition file have been made, and should be included in this repository. It's easy if you use 
the [AsyncAPI Generator](https://github.com/asyncapi/generator) by Fran MÃ©ndez:

```
npm install -g asyncapi-generator
```

The following command (PC-version) will create a `api/playerapi.md` file from `api/playerapi.yaml`:

```
ag -o .\api .\api\playerapi.yaml markdown 
```
